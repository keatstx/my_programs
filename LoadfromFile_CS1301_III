#Write a function called "load_file" that accepts one 
#parameter: a filename. The function should open the
#file and return the contents.#
#
# - If the contents of the file can be interpreted as
#   an integer, return the contents as an integer.
# - Otherwise, if the contents of the file can be
#   interpreted as a float, return the contents as a
#   float.
# - Otherwise, return the contents of the file as a
#   string.
#
#You may assume that the file has only one line.
#
#Hints:
#
# - Don't forget to close the file when you're done!
# - Remember, anything you read from a file is
#   initially interpreted as a string.


#Write your function here!
#def load_file(filename):
#    inputfile = open(filename,"r")
#    file = inputfile.readline().strip()
#    inputfile.close()
#    if type(file) is int:
#        return int(file)
#    elif isinstance(file,float):
#        return float(file)
#    
#    return str(file)
def load_file(filename):
    files = open(filename,"r")
    filesread = files.readline()

    try:
        newfiles = int(filesread)
        return newfiles

            return newfiles

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.

#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print 123, followed by <class 'int'>.
