#Write a function called "scramble" that accepts a string
#as an argument and returns a new string. The new string 
#should start with the last half of the original string
#and end with the first half. 
#
#If the length of the string is odd, split the string 
#at the floor of the length / 2 (in other words, the second
#half is the longer half).
#
#For example:
#  scramble("abcd") -> "cdab"
#  screamble("abcde") -> "cdeab"
#  scramble("railroad")) -> "roadrail"
#  scramble("fireworks")) -> "worksfire"


#Write your function here!
def scramble(a_string):
    l = len(a_string)
    cut = int(l/2)
    return a_string[cut:l+1] + a_string[0:cut]


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print the results you see in the examples above.

string1 = "abcd"
string2 = "abcde"
string3 = "railroad"
string4 = "fireworks"
print(string1 + " -> " + scramble(string1))
print(string2 + " -> " + scramble(string2))
print(string3 + " -> " + scramble(string3))
print(string4 + " -> " + scramble(string4))

#answer key
#We'll start with our function header:

def scramble(word):
    
    #Next, we need to get the first half and the second half
    #of the word. We can do that with string slicing. First,
    #we want to calculate the midpoint of the word. The
    #directions said to use floor division, so we'll do this:
    
    midpoint = len(word) // 2
    
    #So, the first half of the string is the first character
    #through the midpoint, and the second half is the
    #midpoint through the end:
    
    first_half = word[:midpoint]
    second_half = word[midpoint:]
    
    #Now, we return the result of adding them together in
    #reverse:
    
    return second_half + first_half

    #We actually could also do that all in one longer line:
    #
    #return word[len(word) // 2:] + word[:len(word) // 2)]


string1 = "abcd"
string2 = "abcde"
string3 = "railroad"
string4 = "fireworks"
print(string1 + " -> " + scramble(string1))
print(string2 + " -> " + scramble(string2))
print(string3 + " -> " + scramble(string3))
print(string4 + " -> " + scramble(string4))
