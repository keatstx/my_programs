#Write a function called "angry_file_finder" that accepts a
#filename as a parameter. The function should open the file,
#read it, and return True if the file contains "!" on every
#line. Otherwise the function should return False. 
#
#Hint: there are lots of ways to do this. We'd suggest using
#either the readline() or readlines() methods. readline()
#returns the next line in the file; readlines() returns a
#list of all the lines in the file.


#Write your function here!
#def angry_file_finder(filename):
#    result = []
#    word_check = open(filename,"r")
#    for item in word_check:
#        if "!" in word_check.read():
#            result = result.append(True)
#        else:
#            result = result.append(False)
#        word_check.close()    
#    if False in result:
#        return False
#        return True
def angry_file_finder(filename):
    find = False
    filecheck= open(filename,"r")
    readfiles = filecheck.readlines()
    for item in readfiles:
        if "!" in item:
            find = True
        else:
            return False
    filecheck.close()
    return True
      


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: True
