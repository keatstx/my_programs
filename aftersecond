#Write a function called after_second that accepts two 
#arguments: a target string to search, and string to search
#for. The  function should return everything in the first
#string *after* the *second* occurrence of the search term.
#You can assume  there will always be at least two
#occurrences of the search term in the first string. 
#
#For example:
#  after_second("11223344554321", "3") -> 44554321
#
#The search term "3" appears at indices 4 and 5. So, this
#returns everything from the index 6 to the end.
#
#  after_second("heyyoheyhi!", "hey") -> hi!
#
#The search term "hey" appears at indices 0 and 5. The
#search term itself is three characters. So, this returns
#everything from the index 8 to the end.
#
#Hint: This may be more complicated than it looks! You'll
#have to look at the length of the search string and
#either modify the target string or take advantage of the
#extra arguments you can pass to find().


#Write your function here!
def after_second(target, search):
    
    stringL= len(search)
    first = target.find(search)
    second = target.find(search,first+1)
    return target[second+stringL:]


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print 44554321 and hi!, each on their own line.
print(after_second("11223344554321", "3"))
print(after_second("heyyoheyhi!", "hey"))



#answer key
#We'll start with the function header as usual. target is
#the string we're searching within, and search is the string
#we're searching for:
def after_second(target, search):
    
    #We can do this in two ways. First, let's do it with
    #arguments to the find() method. First, we want to find
    #the first place that search appears:
    
    first_loc = target.find(search)
    
    #Next, we want to find the second location where search
    #appears:
    
    second_loc = target.find(search, first_loc + 1)
    
    #Now, second_loc stores the second place that search
    #appears. We want to return everything from after that
    #instance of search -- so, we add the length of search
    #to move past it, and return that substring:
    
    return target[second_loc + len(search):]

#We could do that other ways, too, though. Check out
#sample_answer_2.py and sample_answer_3.py for more!


print(after_second("11223344554321", "3"))
print(after_second("heyyoheyhi!", "hey"))
