#Recall in Unit 3 you wrote a function that would count the
#number of words in a string using loops. Now that you know
#something about string methods, though, let's do that again
#using a different approach.
#
#Write a function called "num_words" that accepts a string 
#as an argument and returns the number of words in the 
#string. You can assume all words are separated by a space,
#and that the string has at least one word. You do not need
#to worry about punctuation.
#
#For example:
#
#  num_words("Veni, Vidi, Vici.") -> 3
#
#This time, you may not use any loops. Hint: split() might
#come in handy.


#Write your function here!
def num_words(string1):
    words = string1.count(" ") +1
    return words



#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 3, 2, 1, each on their own line.
print(num_words("Vini, Vidi, Vici."))
print(num_words("Hello, world!"))
print(num_words("HeyDavidwhyaren'ttherespacesinthissentence"))


#answer key
#First, we'll start with the function header:
def num_words(sentence):
    
    #Using what we know now, we might see that the split()
    #method can help us here! The split() method splits the
    #string into a list of smaller strings, dividing it
    #wherever the string that appears in parentheses is
    #found. So, "two words".split(" ") would split into a
    #list of two strings: "two" and "words".
    #
    #So, however many strings come out of the split(" ")
    #call is the number of words in our sentence:
    
    return len(sentence.split(" "))
    
    #Given the assumption in the problem that spaces always
    #indicate a new word, we could also use the string
    #class's count() method. The count() method counts
    #the number of instances of the string in parentheses.
    #We'll want to add one because there is always one more
    #word than spaces:
    #
    #return sentence.count(" ") + 1
    

print(num_words("Vini, Vidi, Vici."))
print(num_words("Hello, world!"))
print(num_words("HeyDavidwhyaren'ttherespacesinthissentence"))
